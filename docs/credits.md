# Developpers

[Libor Polčák](https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~polcak) was behind an idea to implement a webextension that works as a firewall for JavaScript APIs. He is the current main maintainer. He received support for this project through the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/JSRestrictor/">JavaScript Restrictor</a> project of NGI0 PET Fund, a fund established by NLnet with financial support
		from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet programme, under the aegis of DG
		Communications Networks, Content and Technology under grant agreement No 825310. He supervised/supervises diploma theses that improves the web extension.

Martin Bednář is working on developping and testing the extension as a part of his Ph.D. research.

Zbyněk Červinka developped a [proof-of-concept version](https://github.com/cervinka-zbynek/masters-thesis) of this extension as a part of his [master's thesis](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/thesis/21274/) (in Czech).

Martin Timko developped first public versions upto [0.2.1](https://github.com/polcak/jsrestrictor/releases/tag/0.2.1) as a part of his [master's thesis](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/thesis/21824/). He also  ported the extension to Chrome and Opera.

Pavel Pohner developed the Network Boundary Scanner as a part of his master's thesis.

Pater Horňák ported functionality from [Chrome Zero](https://github.com/IAIK/ChromeZero) as a part
of his bachelor thesis. He also provided several small fixes to the code base.

# Key ideas

The development of this extension is influenced by the paper [JavaScript Zero: Real JavaScript and Zero Side-Channel Attacks](https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/de/publications/javascript-zero-real-javascript-and-zero-side-channel-attacks). It appeared during the work of Zbyněk Červinka and provided basically the same approach to restrict APIs as was at the time developped by Zbyněk Červinka.
